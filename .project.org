- [ ] Explore how to implement state machines in common lisp

* Refile [2/65]
Tasks to be refiled somewhere else in this project

- [ ] Function ~retro-font-string-width~ to calculate width of a string in a
  particular font
- [ ] DEMO: fire effect https://lodev.org/cgtutor/fire.html
- [ ] DEMO: other demos http://demo-effects.sourceforge.net/
- [ ] Starting Canvas from Buffer position ~(0, 0)~ will improve performance?
- [ ] Performance: will diff cause fragmentation? Try to plot always everything and see if performance are more stable
- [ ] Performance: try to reduce fragmentation of lines with the same font-lock, come up with heuristics
  - Leave unchanged only if the whole line is unchanged?
  - Add another passage to remove fragmentation?
- [ ] Pixel grid is a Canvas??? Use Canvas name, Use Screen for what previously called Canvas
- [ ] Try 320x240 with full background (Captain America + tiles)
- [ ] Simulate key-down/key-up with global timer VS key-press
- [ ] Resize pixel-grid
  - [ ] ~(retro--vector-resize width height vector width-scale height-scale) -> (vector . (width . height))~
  - [ ] ~(retro--vector-resize-to-scale width height vector scale) -> (vector . (width . height))~
  - [ ] ~(retro--vector-resize-to-dimension from-width from-height vector to-width to-height) -> vector~
- [ ] Rotate pixel-grid
- [ ] Compose pixel-grids -> pixel-grid
- [ ] Zelda: mechanics, movement, animation, fantastic!!! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QU1pPzEGrqw
- [ ] Create viewport on a canvas or another viewport: a canvas is a viewport,
  when plot something to a viewport if outside of it then plot nothing even if
  inside the original canvas. This feature will enable us to have different part
  of the screen dedicated to display different stuff (scoreboard, dashboard,
  inventory, ...). First use case is the debug viewport to display the name of
  the game, the frame number, current frame per seconds, ...
- [ ] ~retro-sprite-bb~ (Bounding Box)
- [ ] ~retro-sprite-aabb~ (Axis Oriented Bounding Box)
- [ ] Pixel perfect collision detection: ~retro-sprite-bb~ && ~(retro-collide-pp pixel-grid pixel-grid)~
- [X] DEMO: Captain America walking in every direction
- [ ] DEMO: Captain America, walking animation done in update, not in key handlers, for smoother animation, how?
- [ ] DEMO: Captain America, add path (grass/water) in a map bigger than canvas, maybe a labyrinth, follow the sprite
- [ ] Rename things based on the definition of main concepts
  - Buffer (Emacs)
  - Canvas
  - Viewport
  - Screen
  - Tile
  - Background
  - Sprite
    - Play
    - Frame
  - Font
    - Glyph
  - Face
    - Color
- [ ] DEMO: Pink walk, jump, throw
- [ ] GAME: Pong
- [ ] disable buffer selection in ~*retro*~ buffers
- [ ] disable cursor  ~(internal-show-cursor WINDOW SHOW)~
- [ ] FIX: arrow keys still move point
- [ ] Implement ~tween-cons~
- [ ] how to check if a file/function is byte compiled
- [ ] how to check if a file/function is natively compiled
- [ ] ~assert~ that it's only checked if it's not byte compiled aka optimized? Or if debugging is turned on
  - [ ] when are macros really expanded?
- [ ] add bounding box to sprite and tiles
- [ ] functions to compose one or more tiles
- [ ] test with calibrate.sprite and clipping with buttercup?

- [ ] collision detection between elements
- [ ] track and display the fps somewhere
- [ ] duff device to plot in buffer to reduce the number of while iterations,
  define macro ~(unrolled-times N (V M) BODY)~ with throw/catch (only after
  having benchmarks, keep this only if it will bring better performance)
- [ ] blog posts on the optimization journey for ~retro.el~
- [ ] ~(retro--sprite-flip-v sprite)~
- [ ] ~(retro--tile-flip-v)~
- [X] garbage collection trick?
- [ ] extract example and ask for possible improvements on emacs-devel ml
- [ ] add hook on window resize -> font dimension resize
- [ ] special mode buffer? create a major mode for retro mode?
- [ ] major mode for sprite files with instant preview (side by side buffer)
- [ ] utility to import an image file into a sprite file in ~Rust~ or ~C~
- [ ] Have a way to use ~retro.el~ to create an "image" in part of the buffer.
  Can be helpful to show graphical things without using or producing images or
  better for animated graphics because images in this case is not an option.
- [ ] Explore if there are audio servers that can be used by Emacs, should work
  like that: Emacs connects to the audio server and when a piece of audio needs
  to be played it can be sent to the server, better if all the audio can be pre
  loaded in the server and then played by index or something.
